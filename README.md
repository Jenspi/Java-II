## Table of Contents:
### HW1: Shapes
Using a class written by the professor, I wrote classes for three different shapes (a triangle, rectangle, and circle) which inherited his class. This allowed us to "plot" shapes with coordinates. This assignment was more practice with inheritance, as well as the introduction to using javadocs.

### HW2: Recursion
This algorithm finds the smallest string, either in an array or given two options. This program, of course, gives us experience with recursion.

### HW4: Sorting and Searching
Searched & sorted using abstract bubble sort, merge sort, binary (recursive) search, and selection sort. I used a Dog class we wrote during class, but the methods were written so that they could be used on any class. This assignment helped teach us not only different sorting methods, but also abstraction.

### HW5: Lists and Iterators
Taking knowledge of how to create a linked list, I was able to create a doubly linked list for this assignment. This assignment taught us how to create & use a doubly linked list, as well as creating an iterator for it.
